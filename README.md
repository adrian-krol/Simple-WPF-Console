Supported versions:
	.NET Framework 4.7 and higher,
	.Net Core 3.1 and higher,

A simple console\\terminal window for use in a WPF application, this is a user control that will allow the user to enter a line of text (script\\command) and\or display a list of items in a console\\terminal style.

This user control does NOT actually do anything more than display data - the user control is the View (UI) in a MVVM implementation, the ViewModel would be responsible for the actual behaviour & contents of the console\\terminal window. The user control is designed to use XAML binding for all UI properties the user can configure.
